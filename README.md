# BNControl-lib
Library of functions for control of Boolean networks

The library is implemented in Wolfram Language (Mathematica), there are two core algorithms for the computation of control sets available as two options of destify in (ActoNetLib.nb) :

1) Integer Linear Programming 
2) Binary Decision Diagrams (detailed in BDD-destify.nb)
